# What's new in SCAD Containers Cost Allocation Dashboard

## SCAD Containers Cost Allocation Dashboard - v4.0.0

* New features:
  * You can now [add your K8s pods labels](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guidance/latest/cloud-intelligence-dashboards/scad-containers-dashboard-add-labels-tags.html) to the Athena view and to the dashboard, and use them in visuals
  * The [Kubernetes Recommended Labels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/common-labels/), and the labels `app`, `chart`, `release`, `version`, `component`, `type` and `created-by`, are included by default in the Athena view and dashboard, in the "Workloads Explorer" sheet, as group-by dimensions and filters ([activating their respective cost allocation tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/activating-tags.html) is required)
  * New "Labels/Tags Explorer" and "Data on EKS" sheets have been added to the dashboard, leveraging Kubernetes pods labels for their respective use-cases:
    * [Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guidance/latest/cloud-intelligence-dashboards/scad-containers-dashboard-tco.html):  
    As part of the new "Labels/Tags Explorer" sheet, you can now allocate the TCO of your applications running on EKS/ECS clusters, including both the split cost and the costs of other AWS resources, through consistent labeling/tagging of the pods/tasks and AWS resources
    * [Cost Allocation for Spark and Flink Applications Running on EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guidance/latest/cloud-intelligence-dashboards/scad-containers-dashboard-data-on-eks.html):  
    As part of the new "Data on EKS" sheet, you can now allocate costs to your Spark and Flink applications running on EKS or on EMR on EKS, using labels that are automatically applied to the pods when the jobs are submitted, and are used in the Athena view and dashboard by default

## SCAD Containers Cost Allocation Dashboard - v3.0.1

* Fixed an issue with CPU and GPU cost showing 0

## SCAD Containers Cost Allocation Dashboard - v3.0.0
* New features:
  * GPU cost support (Amazon EKS only), reflected as follows:
    * New KPI visual in the "Executive Summary" sheet
    * GPU cost is included in "Cost Metric" drop-down list in all sheets
    * GPU cost is included in the calculation of "Total Cost" cost metric in all sheets
    * GPU Cost column added to the pivot in "Workloads Explorer" sheet
  * AWS Fargate support (Amazon EKS and Amazon ECS), reflected as follows:
    * All data in the dashboard now includes Fargate pods/tasks, in any visual, unless filtered by the user 
    * Added "Launch Type" control to all sheets, includes the options "EC2" and "Fargate"
    * Added "Launch Type" option in the "Group By" control in the "Workloads Explorer" sheet
  * Added EC2 instance processor fields, reflected as follows:
    * New "Processor Family" filter and group-by option in the "Workloads Explorer" sheet (values examples: Graviton, AMD, Intel, Apple). Based on the value from the `product[physical_processor]` CUR column
    * New "Processor" filter and group-by option in the "Workloads Explorer" sheet, includes the exact processor name from the `product[physical_processor]` CUR column
    * New processor family coverage visual in the "Cluster Breakdown" sheet
* Bug fixes:
  * Fixed JOIN issue with daily and monthly CUR, which resulted in missing data
* Removals:
  * Removed the following KPI visuals from the "Executive Summary" sheet: "Total Clusters", "Total EC2 Instances", "Total EKS Pods", "Total ECS Tasks"

## SCAD Containers Cost Allocation Dashboard - v2.0.0
* Added support for AWS Split Cost Allocation Data (SCAD) for ECS:
  * All visuals now include SCAD ECS data (including AWS Batch on ECS), in addition to SCAD EKS data
  * The "EKS Breakdown" sheet has been renamed "Cluster Breakdown"
* CUR 2.0 support: The dashboard now defaults to CUR 2.0, and still supports legacy CUR
* The `scad_cca_summary_view` and `scad_cca_hourly_resource_view` Athena views have been converged to a single view.  
The time and data granularity levels remain the same, but now in a single view instead of 2 views
* The hourly and resource-level interactive visuals in the "Cluster Breakdown" sheet have been removed, and converged with the visuals in the "Workloads Explorer" tab, which now have hourly and resource-level data, in addition to the current granularity levels in these visuals

Notes:  
* For this version (v2.0.0), the minimum required `cid-cmd` version is 4.0.9
* Starting this version (v2.0.0), the `scad_cca_hourly_resource_view` QuickSight dataset and Athena view are no longer used by the dashboard.  
Following an upgrade to this version (v2.0.0), after verifying functionality of the dashboard, you can delete the `scad_cca_hourly_resource_view` QuickSight dataset and Athena view (in this order).  
They won't be deleted automatically, and will continue refreshing and incurring cost if you don't delete them.  
Deleting the `scad_cca_hourly_resource_view` QuickSight dataset and Athena view is not necessary on a new installation of the dashboard, only following an upgrade.

## SCAD Containers Cost Allocation Dashboard - v1.0.0
* Added support to view Net Amortized Cost in "View Cost As" control in all sheets
* Removed "Exclude last 1 month" from all date range controls to prevent "No Data" (because Split Cost Allocation Data for EKS starts filling data only in current month)
* Fixed issue where all split cost and usage metrics were lower than they should be, for pods on EC2 instances that were running for less than a full hour
* Fixed aggregation issues for usage metrics in Athena views

## SCAD Containers Cost Allocation Dashboard - v0.0.1
* Initial release
